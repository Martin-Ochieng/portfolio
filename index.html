I hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Kenyatta University, where I graduated with Second Class Honors (Upper Division). I have worked at Safaricom PLC as a Software Engineer, focusing on Financial Services Systems Planning, and at Eenovators Ltd as an Energy Engineer/Software Developer. My career has been marked by delivering high-quality user experiences and tackling complex problems using big data and AI.

            My interests/hobbies/skills: I am passionate about sustainability and technology, aiming to develop solutions that contribute to a greener, more sustainable future. I have expertise in programming languages such as Java, C, Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and SQL, and am proficient with frameworks and tools like SpringBoot, Flask, Django, and REST APIs. I have hands-on experience with big data platforms such as Azure and custom-built energy management platforms, and cloud technologies like Azure, AWS, and HCS. My development methodologies include Agile (Scrum), and I possess strong soft skills, including adaptability, collaboration, quick learning, reliability, and a customer-focused approach. In my personal time, I stay updated on tech trends, enjoy coding as a hobby, and engage in community service to leverage my skills for social good.
